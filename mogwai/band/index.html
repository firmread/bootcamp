	<p>Mogwai are a Scottish post-rock band, formed in 1995 in Glasgow. The band consists of Stuart Braithwaite (guitar, vocals), John Cummings (guitar, vocals), Barry Burns (guitar, piano, synthesizer, vocals), Dominic Aitchison (bass guitar), and Martin Bulloch (drum kit). The band typically compose lengthy guitar-based instrumental pieces that feature dynamic contrast, melodic bass guitar lines, and heavy use of distortion and effects.</p><br><br>

	<h1>History</h1><br><br>

	<p>Stuart Braithwaite and Dominic Aitchison originally met in April 1991, and four years later added old schoolfriend Martin Bulloch to their ranks, forming the band Mogwai in the process.[1] The band is named after the creatures from the film Gremlins, although guitarist Stuart Braithwaite comments that "it has no significant meaning and we always intended on getting a better one, but like a lot of other things we never got round to it."[2] 'Mogwai' means "evil spirit" or "devil" in Cantonese (Chinese: 魔鬼; Mandarin Pinyin: móguǎi; Jyutping: mo¹gwai²). The band debuted in February 1996 with the "Tuner"/"Lower" single and by the end of the year they received 'single of the week' from NME for "Summer", a feat repeated early in 1997 with "New Paths to Helicon".[1] After playing a few shows the band expanded with the introduction of John Cummings on guitar, and Teenage Fanclub drummer Brendan O'Hare joined whilst they recorded their debut album Mogwai Young Team.[1] The album, released in October 1997, reached number 75 on the UK Albums Chart, and featured a guest appearance from Aidan Moffat of Arab Strap.[1] In 1998 the band had their first singles chart success with a split single with Magoo of Black Sabbath cover versions reaching number 60 in the UK and an EP of "Fear Satan" remixes reaching number 57.[1] In the same year, an album of remixes of the band's tracks by the likes of Kevin Shields, Alec Empire, and μ-ziq was issued (Kicking a Dead Pig).[3] The band also remixed tracks for David Holmes and Manic Street Preachers.[3] The band have often been critical of other musicians, including Blur (who were the subject of T-shirts sold by the band featuring the words "Blur Are Shite"), Robbie Williams, and Axl Rose.[4][5]</p><br>
	<p>The band were for several years signed to renowned Glasgow indie label Chemikal Underground, but are now distributed by different labels, such as Matador in the US and Play It Again Sam in the UK. They have also developed their own label, Rock Action Records, named after Stooges drummer Scott Asheton, who had his name changed to Rock Action.[2]</p><br>
	<p>O'Hare was sacked after the release of the album (reportedly after upsetting the rest of the band by talking all through a performance by Arab Strap),[1] before Barry Burns was brought in prior to the recording of Come On Die Young, the band's second album. He had already played a few shows with the band, as a flautist and as an occasional pianist. According to Stuart, Barry was invited into the band because he was a good laugh.[2] The album reached number 29 in the UK.[1] Since 1998, and for the recording of every album since Young Team, the band line up has remained unchanged. However, fellow Scot musician Luke Sutherland has contributed violin (and more recently vocals and guitar) to Mogwai's records and live performances.</p><br>
	<p>The band's 2001 album Rock Action gave them their highest album chart placing, reaching number 23.[1]</p><br>
	<p>In 2006, the band provided the soundtrack to the film Zidane: A 21st Century Portrait, with the soundtrack album released the following year.[6] The band also collaborated with Clint Mansell on the soundtrack to The Fountain in 2006.[7] Mogwai are also featured in the 2009 post-rock documentary Introspective.[8]</p><br>
	<p>The band's 2008 Batcat EP featured a collaboration with Roky Erickson, with Erickson providing vocals on "Devil Rides".[7][9]</p><br>
	<p>In 2010 the band announced the release of their first live film (Burning, premiered at the Glasgow Film Festival in February 2010) and live album (called Special Moves); Both contain content from their Brooklyn shows during their 2008/2009 American tour.[10][11][12] Braithwaite also stated that the band were working on material for a new album for release in early 2011.[12] In January 2010 the band auctioned off several items including the piano used by Burns during their 2006-2007 world tour in aid of the 2010 Haiti earthquake appeal.[13] The band also donated an exclusive track to the PEACE project in April 2010 in support of Amnesty International.[14]</p><br>
	<p>As of September 2010, Mogwai have left longtime home Matador Records, and have signed with Sub Pop to distribute their releases in North America. On 27 October 2010, Mogwai announced their seventh studio album, Hardcore Will Never Die, But You Will.[15][16] The album was released on the 14th February in the UK and entered the UK Albums Chart at number 25.[17]</p><br><br><br>
